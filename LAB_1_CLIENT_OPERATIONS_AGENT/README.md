To improve the model performance in Thai even further, watsonx Orchestrate supports using external models through feature called `AI gateway`. Read more later at: https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/llm/managing_llm


4. Our goal is to add `google/gemini-2.5-flash` to watsonx Orchestrate. Rename `env-template` to `.env` and add in your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.Please visit https://aistudio.google.com and click generate an API key to get your API key.

NOTE:
If you are unable to create api key, it means you haven't enabled Gemini API in Google cloud console and created a project. Hence please, enable gemini API and create a project.

5. Ensure you have completed the instructions in `00_SETUP`. Now that you have all credentials, add the model as follows. Choose to follow either UI or ADK.

    ### UI (Simplified instructions)

    Please navigate to the connections tab. And add a connection.
    ![alt text](images/gateway_1.png)

    Here you can create a connection called `gg_creds_UI`

    ![alt text](images/gateway_2.png)

    For draft environment, select the `Key Value Pair` and add the key value pair in. The key is `api_key` and the value is the API key from Gemini API you got earlier.

    Please repeat the same of live environment,
    The key is `api_key` and the value is the API key from Gemini API you got earlier.

    Once added connections, please navigate to your powershell/ terminal and type in the following command. This steps assumed you have completed `00_SETUP`

    Here is the comamnd
    ```
    orchestrate models add --name google/gemini-2.5-flash --app-id gg_creds_UI
    ```
    You should see gemini-2.5-flash model being added.

    **NOTE**: Additionally, watsonx Orchestrate provides the ability for developers to perform end to end connections creation to adding model with the ADK. Feel free to try this out at home.

    ## End of Labs
    ---

    ### End to end using ADK (Optional)

	**For Linux/macOS:**
	1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `AI_gateway/` folder.
	2. Make the scripts executable (run this once):
		```bash
		chmod +x set_connections.sh add_models.sh
		```
	3. Run the scripts:
		```bash
		./set_connections.sh
		./add_models.sh
		```

	**For Windows (PowerShell):**
	1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the `AI_gateway` folder.
	2. If you haven't already, allow running local scripts:
		```powershell
		Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
		```
		Then restart PowerShell.
	3. Run the scripts:
		```powershell
		./set_connections.ps1
		./add_models.ps1
		```
	4. If you get an error that the script is not digitally signed (i.e., it does not have a trusted publisher's signature and was downloaded or created locally), run the following to unblock the files, then try again:
		```powershell
		Unblock-File -Path .\set_connections.ps1
		Unblock-File -Path .\add_models.ps1
		```

	You should see the model being added.
